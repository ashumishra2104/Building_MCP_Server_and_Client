# 🤖 Building MCP Servers — by Ashu Mishra

> A hands-on collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers built from scratch — designed for AI Product Management students and developers who want to give Claude real-world superpowers.

## 🧠 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets you connect AI models like Claude to external tools, data sources, and services.

Think of it like this:

```
Claude (Brain) + MCP Server (Hands) = Claude that can actually DO things
```

Instead of Claude just *talking* about running a command, creating a file, or fetching data — with an MCP server, it can actually **do it**.
